# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[PACKAGE](LINK) - DESCRIPTION.`
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

The rules above take precedence, but in case I missed something, check [the
awesome guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md)
too.

Your contributions are always welcome!  Thank you for your suggestions!
